# Lesson 2: Basic Concepts in C Programming
## Data Types
In C programming, data types are used to define the type of data that a variable can hold. The basic data types in C programming include:

- int: used for integer values
- float: used for floating-point values
- double: used for double-precision floating-point values
- char: used for single character values
- void: used to represent the absence of a data type

## Variables and Constants
Variables are used in C programming to store data that can be modified during program execution. Constants, on the other hand, are used to store data that cannot be modified during program execution.

To declare a variable in C programming, you must specify its data type and a name for the variable. For example:

```c
int age;

```
This declares a variable named "age" that can hold integer values.

To declare a constant in C programming, you must use the "const" keyword before the variable declaration. For example:

```c
/* const data type assign */
const float P.I = 3.14259;

```
This declares a constant named "PI" that holds a floating-point value of 3.14159.

## Operators
Operators are used in C programming to perform mathematical and logical operations on variables and constants. The basic operators in C programming include:

- Arithmetic operators: + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), % (modulus)
- Comparison operators: == (equality), != (inequality), > (greater than), < (less than), >= (greater than or equal to), <= (less than or equal to)
- Logical operators: && (logical AND), || (logical OR), ! (logical NOT)
- Assignment operators: = (simple assignment), += (addition assignment), -= (subtraction assignment), *= (multiplication assignment), /= (division assignment), %= (modulus assignment)

## Control Structures
Control structures are used in C programming to control the flow of program execution. The basic control structures in C programming include:

- If/else statements: used to execute a block of code if a condition is true, and a different block of code if the condition is false.
- For loops: used to execute a block of code a fixed number of times.
- While loops: used to execute a block of code as long as a condition is true.
- Do/while loops: used to execute a block of code at least once, and then continue executing the block of code as long as a condition is true.
In the next lesson, we will cover more advanced concepts in C programming, including arrays, pointers, and functions.
